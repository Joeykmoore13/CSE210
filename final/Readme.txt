This project is designed to simulate both 2x2 and 3x3 Rubik's cubes.
It includes almost all of the possible moves that can be made using the standard cubing notation.
It allows for the saving and loading of cube states.
It also allows for the saving and loading of algorithms.
A help menu option has been added to explain what each of the menu options do and how to use them. 
The help section also has a link on how to read cubing notation and also provides some examples.
